# COMP 313 Project 2

# Individual project

# Objectives

An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

- algorithmic complexity
- runtime performance
  - how to measure
  - how it relates to algorithmic complexity
- abstract data types (ADT)
- array-based versus linked lists
- getting started with iterators
- automated unit testing using JUnit
  - testing for exceptions
  - test fixtures and assertions
  
# Instructions

The key idea is to think about this lab like a physics experiment! 
You will set it up and then take measurements.

1. Import the GitHub repository into your Bitbucket account - see online course website for how to name it
2. Review the code.
3. Fix the syntax errors (if any, though there probably aren't any).
4. Run the code for various inputs to gain an understanding of what it does.
5. Complete the items marked TODO in the code and get the tests to pass.
6. Conduct the performance measurements: you will find the running times in the test report.
7. Create a markdown document called Answers.md or a text document Answers.txt and answer the various questions embedded in the code.

# Deliverables and submission

Please submit the following deliverables:

- Shared Bitbucket Project 2 repository
